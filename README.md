# Meet with your Cohort Lead

One of the five requirements for completing the First Mile course is meeting with
your cohort lead. Book a time to attend one pod meeting during the First Mile. Pod
meetings are available on a first-come, first-served basis, so schedule a time that
works for you right away. Pod meetings are not available on weekends.

If you can’t find a pod meeting time that works for you, reach out directly to your
Instructor. This action is required during your current cohort’s First Mile even if
you have completed it in a previous cohort.

If you need to reschedule, please let your support team know 24 hours in advance.
**Please note that if you cancel/no show your scheduled meeting, another meeting time
within the First Mile is not guaranteed so be sure to make your meeting a priority.**
